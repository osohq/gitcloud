# GitClub (Python - SQLAlchemy - Flask)

This is an example application based on GitHub that's meant to model GitHub's
permissions system. The app uses the [`oso-cloud`][pypi-oso-cloud] library to
model, manage, and enforce authorization.

The [Oso Cloud documentation][docs] is a good reference for more information on
Oso's [Python][docs-python] library.
